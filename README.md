## About me <a name="Introduction1"></a>

Hello! My name is [Melissa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melissalehman1/). You can click on my name to view my LinkedIn profile. I am a dynamic security professional with 10 years in the industry. My background includes RAM (Remote Access Management) as a Supervisor and Salesforce Assistant Administrator as a Supervisor within the Data Entry department. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Business and am currently following my passion in IT. (Believe it or not, at the age of 12 I self taught myself to do basic code on a Macintosh!) Some of my training includes CompTIA A+ (currently studying for certification) and Introduction to QA.

## Documentation <a name="paragraph5"></a>

This is a great place to include a hyperlink so the README file isn't bogged down. Main documentation includes:

* Installation Instructions, API Documents, Benchmark Tests, and changelog.
* [Notes](Notes.txt)

* Created database.py - received successful statement
* Created main.py - will not create family_database.db, will need to review closer for issues.

## Visuals <a name="paragraph6"></a>

## Conclusion <a name="paragraph13"></a>

Going into the Intro to QA course, I had a limited understanding of the field.  The course has opened my eyes to the diverse aspects of QA, from test planning and execution to automation and quality assurance methodologies.  One of my biggest takeaways was learning how to write effective test cases.  While challenging at first, practicing this skill has helped me think critically about software functionality and identify potential issues. I'm excited to apply this knowledge in my upcoming projects.
